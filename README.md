# Brain Tumor Segmentation

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for semantic segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans. The primary goal is to learn and experiment with different semantic segmentation techniques and models.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to build and train a model that can accurately identify and segment different brain tumor subregions from multi-modal MRI data. This involves:

*   Understanding the BraTS 2021 dataset.
*   Implementing and training a segmentation model (e.g., U-Net, MONAI).

## Dataset

This project uses the [Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilroxtomar/brain-tumor-segmentation?select=images), A 2D brain tumor segmentation dataset.

The dataset contains 3064 pairs of MRI brain images and their respective binary mask indicating tumor.

This dataset is the [Figshare Brain Tumor dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427).

## Usage

The project is currently in the research and development phase. The main workflow is captured in the `Brain_tumor_seg.ipynb` notebook.

## Status

This project is currently in the **searching phase**. The focus is on researching and understanding the best approaches for brain tumor segmentation.
